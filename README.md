This project’s value extends far beyond its original scope.
By working through layered identity and access configurations in a realistic operational flow, we uncovered a control sequence that is both Entra-specific and broadly reusable.

We have formally named this sequence **EntraControlStack** — a seven-layer (expandable) framework that begins with authority definition and ends with endpoint compliance assurance. Going forward, this stack will serve as the backbone for project execution, Microsoft Learn material integration, and book chapter organization.

By anchoring every future learning exercise to **EntraControlStack**, we eliminate the fragmentation that often comes from studying Microsoft Entra and Azure in isolation. Each new setting, role, or security control will be mapped to its layer, reinforcing both conceptual understanding and operational readiness.

This ensures that the considerable time investment in this initial project now becomes a compounding asset — the more we build on it, the faster and more cohesive our mastery will grow.
