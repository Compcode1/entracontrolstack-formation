    "**Project Name:**\n",
    "**Tenant Governance: Controlling Users, Groups, and Devices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Objective**\n",
    "To design and configure **tenant-level identity governance** controls that regulate user, group, and device behavior within **Microsoft Entra**. This includes restricting guest invitations, managing group creation rights, enforcing device registration policies, and observing the effects on multiple user types (internal, external, admin, self-service) **across Microsoft 365 and Azure portal access.** The project will follow a facsimile approach, mirroring real-world governance configurations with detailed, procedural execution steps for each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Context and Rationale**\n",
    "**Microsoft Entra tenants** act as the central identity authority for controlling access to applications, services, and resources in a Microsoft cloud environment. Governance at the tenant level ensures that security, compliance, and operational integrity are preserved across all identity-driven activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production environments, a tenant’s governance configuration is not an isolated checklist—it is the backbone of identity lifecycle management, least privilege enforcement, and device trust control. **Without deliberate governance policies, risks emerge in several forms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unauthorized Access Expansion** – If guest invitations are unrestricted, external users can be onboarded without oversight, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shadow IT via Group Creation** – Allowing all users to create Microsoft 365 groups or security groups can result in unmanaged collaboration spaces, untracked permissions, and policy bypass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Device-Based Threat Vectors** – Unregistered or unmanaged devices can connect to corporate resources, bypassing conditional access or compliance checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this project, the governance focus is comprehensive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Users** – Defining role boundaries and enforcing who can invite guests or create groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups** – Restricting creation to designated administrative roles to avoid permission sprawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devices** – Applying device registration limits and restrictions to ensure only compliant endpoints connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make the governance impact measurable, four user types will be evaluated:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Users** – Standard employees within the organization’s domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Users** – Guest accounts from outside domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Administrative Users** – Accounts with elevated permissions that can configure tenant-wide settings and manage identity objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Administrator** – The highest-level role in Microsoft Entra ID. Holds unrestricted permissions to manage all aspects of the tenant, including identity, security, applications, billing, and service settings. Equivalent to a “root” account in other systems, this role should be held by the fewest number of accounts possible, ideally with strong MFA enforcement and conditional access controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Administrator** – A role with delegated authority to manage most aspects of user and group accounts, including password resets, group membership changes, and profile updates. It does not carry full tenant-wide privileges like Global Administrator, but it can still significantly affect identity lifecycle operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Service Users** – Accounts with deliberately constrained privileges, typically configured to simulate the lowest operational authority possible. In this project, these accounts are used to test whether tenant governance policies correctly block unauthorized actions (e.g., creating groups, inviting guests, registering unmanaged devices). **While not a formal Microsoft Entra role type, “self-service” is a descriptive term here for accounts that can only perform actions granted through baseline access rights or explicitly delegated permissions.**\n",
    "**In production, similar accounts may represent contractors, temporary staff, or service accounts with minimal operational scope. Using them in testing helps verify that governance controls are not unintentionally bypassed and that privilege escalation paths are fully restricted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining governance changes against each user type, the project will demonstrate how tenant-level identity governance shapes daily operational access in Microsoft 365 and Azure environments. This allows security teams to verify that policies work as intended, prevent over-privileging, and protect the tenant from uncontrolled identity growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for documenting this in detail is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational Clarity – To ensure that each governance policy’s purpose, scope, and enforcement mechanism is fully understood before implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeatable Process – To establish a procedural reference that can be reused for other tenants, reducing onboarding errors and avoiding misconfiguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Governance Scope Definition**\n",
    "**Purpose of this section**\n",
    "Define exactly which identities, groups, devices, and portals are governed in this project; where the controls apply (tenant-wide versus scoped); which exceptions exist; and how enforcement and auditability are handled. This forms the “contract” for all later configuration and testing. **In a Microsoft Entra governance project, the main portals relevant to scope definition are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)**\n",
    "The administrative interface for managing Azure resources, Microsoft Entra ID, Conditional Access, role assignments, subscriptions, and other cloud services.\n",
    "**Governance relevance:** Often restricted so that only admins or specific IT staff can sign in. Prevents ordinary members or guests from exploring service settings, creating resources, or misconfiguring security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microsoft 365 Admin Center (https://admin.microsoft.com)**\n",
    "The admin interface for Microsoft 365 services (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, etc.).\n",
    "**Governance relevance:** Normally accessible only to users with administrative roles. If a governance scope includes limiting this to a very small group, you explicitly list it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application-specific portals** (examples: Intune Admin Center, Defender Security Center, Power Platform Admin Center)\n",
    "**Governance relevance**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and service-level settings can restrict which identities even have a “door” into these portals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-service portals** (examples: My Apps at https://myapps.microsoft.com, Security Info at https://mysignins.microsoft.com)\n",
    "**Governance relevance:** Usually accessible to all users, but can be scoped if you want to test how restrictions on portal access impact password resets, MFA management, or app launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why portals are part of governance scope:**\n",
    "A governance project isn’t only about what users can do once inside the tenant — it’s also about whether they can reach the tools that would let them change settings, see directory information, or access sensitive resources. By explicitly naming which portals are in scope, you prevent accidental overexposure of administrative surfaces and ensure your testing accounts validate both access allowance and denial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Governance layers and scopes**\n",
    "**This project uses two governance layers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tenant scope.** Settings that affect the entire directory. Examples include “Users can create security groups,” “Users can register applications,” guest invitation settings, and device registration limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Administrative Unit scope.** Scoping of administrative roles (for example, User Administrator limited to the HR AU) to constrain who can manage which identities. An Administrative Unit (AU) is a logical container used to delegate admin roles over a subset of directory objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: User Administrator**. A built-in Microsoft Entra role that can create, update, and delete users; reset passwords (including for privileged roles); manage group membership; and invite external users, within the role’s assignment scope (tenant or AU).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Global Administrator.** The highest-privilege Entra role with full control over directory settings, identities, and roles, including the ability to assign roles to others and change tenant-level properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Identity scope (who is governed)**\n",
    "**Internal members.** All user accounts with userType = Member.\n",
    "**External guests.** All user accounts with userType = Guest (B2B collaboration).\n",
    "**Administrative users.** A small, named set of privileged identities used to perform governance (for example, Global Administrator, User Administrator).\n",
    "**Self-service test users.** Low-privilege test identities created to validate boundary conditions (for example, whether non-admins can create groups or invite guests after restrictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Guest user (B2B).** An external identity represented in the tenant with userType = Guest, authenticated by its home identity provider and governed by external collaboration settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guest user is Microsoft’s official directory term** — it’s the label used in the UI, PowerShell, Graph API, and documentation when describing an account with userType = Guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External guest is not a formal Microsoft schema term** — it’s an operational description some people use to clarify that the guest is coming from outside the home tenant (i.e., via B2B collaboration or federation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "All guest users are external identities unless you’ve created an unusual internal account and manually set userType = Guest (which is rare).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling them external guests can be helpful in a governance project when you want to emphasize source of identity (external to your tenant) rather than just directory object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Group scope (what group objects are in play)**\n",
    "**Security groups.** Used to assign access to apps and resources and to target policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microsoft 365 groups**. Provide collaboration workloads (Teams, SharePoint, Planner, Outlook). Creation can be restricted to a specific security group as part of governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Group creation policy (Microsoft 365). An Exchange Online policy that restricts who can create Microsoft 365 groups by limiting creation to members of a designated security group. This is more granular than the directory-wide toggle and is the preferred control for M365 group creation in production.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4 Device scope (which device states are governed)**\n",
    "**Azure AD registered**. A personal or BYOD device registered for SSO/MFA, not managed by the organization.\n",
    "**Azure AD joined**. A corporate device joined to Entra ID for enterprise management.\n",
    "**Hybrid Azure AD joined.** A device joined to on-premises AD and registered in Entra ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Device registration settings.** Tenant properties that control who can register or join devices, the maximum number of devices per user, and whether MFA is required to register/join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5 Portal and application scope**\n",
    "**Azure portal access**. Whether non-admin users can sign in to the Azure portal. This project restricts portal access to reduce attack surface while not impacting Microsoft 365 access.\n",
    "**Application registration.** Whether users can register application objects and service principals. This project disables general user app registration and assigns App Registration capabilities only to a controlled admin group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: App registration.** Creation of an application object and service principal in Entra ID to enable authentication and authorization for an app or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.6 External collaboration scope**\n",
    "Guest invitation policy. Restrict invitation rights to admins or a named group; set default guest permissions and collaboration restrictions.\n",
    "Domain restrictions (optional). If required, limit guest invitations to an allowlist of partner domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.7 Exceptions and break-glass access**\n",
    "**Emergency access accounts**. Two cloud-only Global Administrator accounts with strong, unique credentials and excluded from restrictive policies. Their sole purpose is tenant recovery.\n",
    "**Executive or service exception groups (optional).** Explicit allow or exclude lists for policies such as group creation or app registration to avoid operational dead-ends while governance is tightened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Emergency access account (“break-glass”).** An account kept outside normal controls (for example, MFA registration enforcement, Conditional Access) to guarantee access during outages or lockouts. Compensating controls include long, vaulted credentials and continuous sign-in alerting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long, vaulted credentials**\n",
    "**Long:** The password is intentionally very long — often 30–64+ characters — to maximize entropy and resist brute-force attacks.\n",
    "**Vaulted:** The password is stored in a secure, access-controlled vault (e.g., Azure Key Vault, a dedicated hardware security module, or a tightly restricted password manager) rather than memorized or stored locally.\n",
    "**Purpose:** Reduces the likelihood that the break-glass account can be compromised while it’s inactive for long periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous sign-in alerting**\n",
    "**Definition:** A monitoring setup where any sign-in event for the break-glass account triggers an immediate alert to security operations or administrators.\n",
    "**Purpose:** Since break-glass accounts should almost never be used, any activity is suspicious unless it’s part of a planned recovery test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:** This can be done via Entra ID sign-in logs with an alert rule in Microsoft Sentinel or Defender for Cloud Apps, or by integrating with a SIEM/SOAR platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.8 Enforcement model**\n",
    "**Immediate enforcement for directory toggles.** Settings such as “Users can create security groups” or “Users can register applications” take effect upon save and require no rollout phase.\n",
    "**Staged enforcement for dependent controls**. Where controls are implemented via service-specific policies (for example, Microsoft 365 group creation policy in Exchange Online), enforcement ties to that service’s policy propagation, typically minutes to hours.\n",
    "**Rollback plan**. Each control in this section has a documented inverse configuration to return to the pre-change state. \n",
    "A rollback plan is a predefined set of steps that reverses a configuration change, restoring the system to its previous known-good state. It ensures that if a new control causes disruption, security gaps, or unexpected behavior, administrators can quickly revert to the prior configuration with minimal downtime and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rollback plans typically take one of two forms:**\n",
    "**Inline Rollback** – The reversal steps are documented directly beneath each control in the main enforcement section. This keeps the change and its undo process side-by-side for quick reference during urgent situations.\n",
    "**Centralized Rollback Log** – All reversal instructions are stored in a dedicated section or document, mapping each control to its inverse configuration in one place. This provides a single reference point, often paired with validation steps and change tracking.\n",
    "**Rollback Approach:** For each enforcement control in this section, the inverse configuration is documented immediately below the control’s primary steps. This inline approach ensures rapid reference and execution in case the change introduces instability, operational impact, or security gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.9 Logging and auditability**\n",
    "**Change audit.** All changes to tenant properties and user settings are captured in the **Entra Audit log**, searchable by actor, target, and operation.\n",
    "**Sign-in evidence.** Impact on user and guest sign-ins is visible in the **Sign-in logs.**\n",
    "**Diagnostic export** (not configured here). **In production, Diagnostic settings forward Audit and Sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace for retention and **KQL analysis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition: Audit log.** A Microsoft Entra log capturing write operations (create, update, delete, policy change) on directory objects and settings.\n",
    "**Definition: Sign-in log.** A Microsoft Entra log capturing authentication attempts, outcomes, conditional access evaluations, device state, and risk information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.10 Out-of-scope items (kept explicit to avoid ambiguity)**\n",
    "**Conditional Access policy design and rollout.** Addressed in a dedicated project.\n",
    "**Privileged Identity Management configuration.** Role assignment lifecycle and JIT elevation are referenced but not configured in this project.\n",
    "**Cross-tenant access settings and cross-tenant sync.** not altered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.11 Named scope artifacts used throughout this project**\n",
    "**Policy-Admins group.** A security group containing identities permitted to perform app registrations and M365 group creation when general users are blocked.\n",
    "**Exception-M365-GroupCreators group.** The allowlist for Microsoft 365 group creation policy in Exchange Online.\n",
    "**Exception-GuestInviters group.** The allowlist for guest invitation rights when member-level invitations are disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.12 Success criteria for scope definition**\n",
    "Controls are precisely tied to the identity, group, device, and portal scopes described above.\n",
    "Every restriction has a documented exception path and a rollback.\n",
    "Audit evidence exists for each change, and validation steps later in the project can demonstrate the intended allow/deny behaviors for members, guests, admins, and self-service test users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Test Identities**\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "To establish controlled, non-production accounts that simulate various role assignments, user states, and department affiliations. These accounts enable safe validation of enforcement controls without affecting production identities or live operational workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "This section covers the creation and configuration of **internal test accounts**, ensuring they accurately reflect the scenarios required for Administrative Unit (AU) role scoping, enforcement policies, and AU membership edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Steps**\n",
    "Define Test Account Naming Convention\n",
    "Use a prefix such as test_ followed by department and role (e.g., test_hr_user1, test_sales_mgr1).\n",
    "Ensure usernames are unique and clearly identifiable in logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Core Test Accounts**\n",
    "HR Department: test_hr_user1@contoso.com\n",
    "Sales Department: test_sales_user1@contoso.com\n",
    "IT Department: test_it_user1@contoso.com\n",
    "Multi-AU User: test_shared_user@contoso.com (assigned to HR and Sales AUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assign Appropriate Licenses**\n",
    "Allocate the minimum license set required to access the Microsoft Entra portal and receive assigned roles.\n",
    "Exclude premium features not needed for testing to reduce cost impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Map Accounts to Administrative Units**\n",
    "Assign each test account to its respective AU(s) in line with the simulation plan.\n",
    "Confirm membership changes via portal or PowerShell output before applying enforcement controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assign Scoped Roles for Testing**\n",
    "Use the same built-in roles from Section 2 (Password Administrator, User Administrator, Authentication Policy Administrator).\n",
    "Scope each role to its corresponding AU for accurate delegation simulation.\n",
    "Record Role and AU Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintain a test account matrix in the project log:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Account\tAU Membership\tAssigned Role\tScope Type\n",
    "test_hr_user1\t    HR\t        TBD             TBD\n",
    "test_sales_user1\tSales\t        TBD             TBD\n",
    "test_it_user1\t    IT\t        TBD\t            TBD\n",
    "test_shared_user\tHR + Sales\t  TBD\t            TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Controls for Test Accounts**\n",
    "Require strong passwords and enable MFA where compatible with the test scenario.\n",
    "Restrict sign-ins from approved IP ranges to reduce exposure risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rollback Approach**\n",
    "**Inline rollback** will be applied: test accounts can be removed from AUs, roles revoked, and accounts disabled or deleted directly through the Microsoft Entra portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logging and Auditability**\n",
    "All account creations, role assignments, and AU membership changes are logged automatically in **Microsoft Entra audit logs.**\n",
    "Administrators performing tests will note expected log entries in the project’s observation section for later validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations**\n",
    "Test accounts should not be reused for unrelated projects to maintain scenario purity.\n",
    "Changes to test identities should be tracked alongside enforcement actions for consistent correlation during observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Guest Invitation Restrictions**\n",
    "**4.1 Purpose**\n",
    "Define and enforce governance around who can invite external (guest) users into the **Microsoft Entra ID tenant.** Restrict guest invitations to controlled groups or roles to prevent uncontrolled external access creation, while maintaining operational flexibility for approved scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.2 Enforcement Model**\n",
    "Configuration Location: Microsoft Entra admin center → Identity → External Identities → External collaboration settings → Guest invite settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available Modes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone in the organization can invite guest users — high flexibility, low security control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Member users and users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users — balanced control for business units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users — highest control; restricts guest creation to privileged admin group.\n",
    "\n",
    "No one in the organization can invite guest users — complete lockdown (usually temporary for compliance events or investigations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected Mode for this Project:** Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users (roles TBD in test matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** Prevents casual or accidental invitations, ensures each new external identity is created with business justification and audit trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.3 Rollback Plan**\n",
    "**Rollback Approach:** Inline — reverse setting to “Member users and users assigned to specific admin roles” or “Anyone in the organization” if business operations require less restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** Inline rollback avoids creating a separate rollback artifact, aligns with this project’s lightweight approach while ensuring that operational disruptions from restricted guest invitation capability can be quickly reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.4 Test Identities**\n",
    "Maintain updated Test Account Matrix in project log:\n",

    "**4.5 Test Scenarios and Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "**Scenario\tSteps\tExpected Outcome\tSecurity Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "**S1:** Standard member attempts guest invitation\tSign in as guest.tester1 → Navigate to Users → New guest user\tFail — “You don’t have permission” error\tConfirms baseline members cannot invite\n",
    "\n",
    "**S2:** AU-scoped admin without invite permission\tSign in as guest.tester2 → Attempt to create guest in AU\tFail — invite control enforced\tVerifies AU scoping does not override tenant-wide invite restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**S3: Role-enabled user** (e.g., User Administrator)\tSign in as manager.hr (with invite role) → Invite guest to HR AU\tSuccess — guest creation allowed, appears in HR AU\tConfirms invite capability works within role scope\n",

    "\n",
    "**Linking Test Identities (4.4) to Scenario Execution (4.5)****\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix in Section 4.4 is not just a static inventory of guest accounts — it is the foundation for interpreting the test results in Section 4.5. Each row in the matrix represents a distinct permission profile deliberately constructed to validate specific enforcement controls. The key to understanding the results in 4.5 is to map each scenario (S1–S4) back to the relevant test identity’s configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "S1 (Baseline members cannot invite) uses guest.tester1@contoso.com, a pure baseline guest with no assigned role and no AU scope. This configuration guarantees that any successful invitation would indicate a policy failure. The “You don’t have permissions” error confirms the intended restriction is functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "S2 (AU-scoped role without invite permission) uses guest.tester2@contoso.com, which has a scoped admin role unrelated to guest invitations. This setup ensures that scope-based delegation does not accidentally inherit invite privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 (Role with global invite permission) uses guest.tester3@contoso.com, which holds the Guest Inviter role without AU scoping, testing the direct capability to bypass baseline restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "S4 (Global Administrator) uses guest.tester4@contoso.com, which inherently has invite permissions, serving as the “full access” benchmark for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design ensures that each scenario’s outcome directly validates — or challenges — the enforcement controls configured earlier in the project. The deliberate use of “TBD” roles and “N/A” scopes in the matrix reflects accounts intentionally left without elevated permissions to serve as baseline controls, not as oversights. Understanding this mapping is critical: the 4.4 matrix is the control blueprint, and the 4.5 execution is the live validation against that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.6 Observation and Auditability**\n",
    "**Portal Evidence:** Invite controls (UI option visibility) change instantly upon configuration adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audit Logs:** Azure AD audit logs show:\n",
    "Add user events for successful guest invitations (Category: UserManagement).\n",
    "Add user failed events with “Insufficient privileges” for blocked attempts.\n",
    "Log Fields to Capture: Initiator UPN, Target user principal name, Result status, Role assignment at time of attempt.\n",
    "Correlation: Compare attempted invites with current role assignments to ensure correct enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.7 Key Learnings**\n",
    "Restricting guest invitations to specific admin roles reduces risk of uncontrolled external collaboration.\n",
    "AU scoping does not inherently grant guest invite capability — it must be explicitly provided via a role.\n",
    "Global Administrator always bypasses these restrictions, highlighting the need for least-privilege principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MID PROJECT SUMMARY RECAP**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 1 – Administrative Unit (AU) Creation**\n",
    "The project begins by establishing the foundation for scoped administration in Microsoft Entra ID through the creation of three Administrative Units — HR Department, Sales Department, and IT Department. **This section walks through the portal navigation path (Entra Portal → Identity → Administrative Units → + New Administrative Unit)**, highlighting that each AU serves as an administrative boundary to which users, groups, and role assignments can be scoped. This is the structural anchor of the project — without AUs, subsequent scoped role testing would not be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2 – Membership Assignment to AUs**\n",
    "With the AUs created, members are added via **AU → Select Members → Add Member**. Each AU receives a primary department-specific user (HR.User1, Sales.User1, IT.User1) and one shared user (Share.User1) who belongs to both HR and Sales. The shared user becomes critical for testing edge cases in cross-AU scenarios. This section links directly back to Section 1’s AU creation and sets the stage for role scoping in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3 – Scoped Role Delegation**\n",
    "**This section introduces three commonly used built-in roles: Password Administrator, User Administrator, and Authentication Policy Administrator**. Each is assigned to a department manager account with the role scope set to their respective AU:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.HR → Password Administrator (HR AU)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Section 4 – Guest Invitation Restrictions**\n",
    "Here, the focus shifts from internal accounts to guest access governance. The section defines baseline guest invitation policies, establishes AU-specific invitation restrictions, and explores how scoped administrators interact with these controls. Test cases examine whether scoped admins without the Guest Inviter role can invite guests, and whether AU scoping changes that outcome. This section links back to Sections 2 and 3 by applying the same scoped membership logic but in the context of guest identity governance, adding another dimension to AU-based delegation testing.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Link to Prior Sections:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Builds on Section 1 & 2 because groups, like users, are objects that can be contained within AUs and assigned specific owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extends Section 3’s scoped role delegation model to the Group Creator capability, testing whether scoped admins or department managers can create groups within their AU, and whether they can create global (tenant-wide) groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherits Section 4’s governance mindset by considering potential risks, such as uncontrolled guest membership if group creation is left unregulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose in the Larger Flow:**\n",
    "It strengthens internal governance by controlling who can create collaboration objects (groups), which is crucial in managing sprawl, ensuring compliance, and maintaining AU-scoped security posture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relates to Section 4 in that guest users may have device registration limitations, and to Section 5 because group-based policies can be applied to device access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose in the Larger Flow:**\n",
    "Device registration governance is the natural next layer in controlling how identities connect to the environment. By regulating which identities can register devices, the project addresses another major vector for unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anticipated cross-section synergy: Device registration restrictions can reinforce guest restrictions (Section 4) and group creation governance (Section 5) by ensuring that neither guests nor improperly scoped admins can onboard unmanaged devices into the tenant.\n",

    "The purpose of this section is to define and test governance controls for Microsoft Entra group creation, ensuring that only authorized roles and scoped administrators can create collaboration objects in alignment with departmental boundaries. Group creation impacts collaboration, security, and compliance; without proper governance, groups can proliferate unchecked, introducing security gaps and administrative overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.2 Scope**\n",
    "This control applies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft 365 Groups and Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Creation from both the Entra Admin Center and connected workloads (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Outlook)\n",
    "\n",
    "AU-scoped and tenant-wide contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Test users and admins from HR, Sales, and IT departments\n",

    "The governance model follows the principle of least privilege:\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, group creation is restricted to administrators and designated owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoped administrators in each AU must demonstrate that they can create groups only within their assigned AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Department managers should not be able to create tenant-wide groups unless explicitly granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Behavioral Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "A scoped admin in the HR AU attempts to create a Microsoft 365 group and a security group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification that these groups appear only within HR’s AU scope.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any bypass (e.g., Teams creation ignoring AU rules) will be flagged for further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This control ties directly to guest restrictions (Section 4), as group owners often invite guests—restricting group creation limits uncontrolled guest entry points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.10 Expected Outcome**\n",

    "\n",
    "While originally scoped as a single-project exercise, the repeated structural themes naturally converged toward a seven-layer operational model for Microsoft Entra ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evolution reflects the fact that certain control sequences — authority definition, scope enforcement, test validation, external entry locking, privilege channel constraints, and device trust — repeatedly appeared regardless of scenario.\n",

    "**Semantic & Relationship Clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise forced clarification of multiple Microsoft Entra terms and their inter-relationships.\n",

    "The repeated mapping of settings, scopes, and role assignments to their functional effect significantly reduced ambiguity, which will directly accelerate comprehension in future learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal vs. Specific Controls**\n",
    "\n",
    "The operational steps were found to be broadly applicable across Microsoft Entra configurations, making them a viable candidate for a repeatable baseline framework.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "**Codified Baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project produced a named, structured framework — **EntraControlStack** — that organizes identity governance and security configuration into discrete, repeatable layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency Gains Identified**\n",
    "\n",
    "By consolidating these layers, investigation and configuration planning can follow a predictable order, avoiding redundant effort and reducing conceptual drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct Future Utility**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project’s value extends far beyond its original scope.\n",
    "By working through layered identity and access configurations in a realistic operational flow, we uncovered a control sequence that is both Entra-specific and broadly reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have formally named this sequence **EntraControlStack** — a seven-layer (expandable) framework that begins with authority definition and ends with endpoint compliance assurance. Going forward, this stack will serve as the backbone for project execution, Microsoft Learn material integration, and book chapter organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By anchoring every future learning exercise to **EntraControlStack**, we eliminate the fragmentation that often comes from studying Microsoft Entra and Azure in isolation. Each new setting, role, or security control will be mapped to its layer, reinforcing both conceptual understanding and operational readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the considerable time investment in this initial project now becomes a compounding asset — the more we build on it, the faster and more cohesive our mastery will grow.\n",
